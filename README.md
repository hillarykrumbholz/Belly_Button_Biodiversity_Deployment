# Belly Button Biodiversity Deployment

## Project Overview
To use Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web. Completed work will then be displayed in a portfolio created for this project that is easily accessible to the public.

### Resources
- Data source: samples.json
- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.40.2, JavaScript (ES6), HTML, GitHub
- JavaScript libraries: D3

### Project Objective
A microbiology lab is looking to use certain bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. The lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food startup that is wantiing to synthesize meat from a micro-organism, possibly a bacterial species that is found on the human body. Roza, a microbiologist in that lab hypothesizes the ideal bacterial species is found in the belly button. 

People from across the country have volunteered for their navels to be tested for bacterial species. They have anonyminity by being assigned ID numbers. The goal is to build a dashboard that researchers and research participants can access and look at which species is found on each individual. 

### Project Summary
To display a demographic information panel, where you can look up a participant by their anonymous ID number. Then to create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel and to select only the most populous species, and to
create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
